# GD-Copyrighted-Song-Replacement
<p>Since there are many official level song being copyrighted, I make this mainly for myself but anyone want to use, feel free to use it</p>
<p>Please note that some song is worse than other song is because the source I managed to find, which might be good but might be bad for other. It also didn't check for sync yet</p>
